# sql-aml-compliance-portfolio

Hello everyone my name is Damian Diaz 

This repository showcases practical SQL projects focused on Anti-Money Laundering (AML),
Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF), transaction monitoring, and financial crime analytics.

The portfolio is designed to complement my professional experience as an AML and Financial
Crime Analyst, demonstrating how data analysis and SQL can be applied to real-world
compliance, investigation, and risk management scenarios.

## About Me

I am a dedicated AML / CTF Analyst and Financial Crime Investigator with hands-on experience
across banking and fintech environments, including Santander Bank and Remitly.

My background spans transaction monitoring, sanctions and watchlist screening, high-risk
customer due diligence, and global case investigations, with a strong focus on regulatory
compliance and risk mitigation. I have worked extensively with high-risk jurisdictions,
PEPs, RCAs, and complex transaction patterns, particularly within the New York regulatory
framework.

This portfolio reflects my transition from operational investigations to a more
data-driven approach, where SQL is used to enhance detection, monitoring, and decision-making
within AML and compliance functions.
